# Inception-of-Things

This project aims to introduce you to kubernetes from a developer perspective. You will have to set up small clusters and discover the mechanics of continuous integration. At the end of this project you will be able to have a working cluster in docker and have a usable continuous integration for your applications.


## Guidelines

- The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine.
- Part 1: K3s and Vagrant
- Part 2: K3s and three simple applications
- Part 3: K3d and Argo CD
- Part 4: Add Gitlab in the lab you did in Part 3

## Tools
- Vagrant
